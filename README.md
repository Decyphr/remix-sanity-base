# Remix & Sanity - Supercharge your web development

This project was bootstrapped with [Remix](https://remix.run) and [Sanity](https://www.sanity.io).

- [Remix docs](https://remix.run/docs)
- [Sanity docs](https://www.sanity.io/docs)

## Getting Started

This project will use [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) as the package manager. Feel free to use npm or yarn if you prefer.

### Install

```bash
pnpm install
```

### Sanity

You can use the Sanity CLI to initialize a new project or connect to an existing one. If you don't have the CLI installed, you can install it globally:

Initialize Sanity within your project:

```bash
npx sanity@latest init --env
```

## Development

Run the Express server with Vite dev middleware:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

## Deployment to Fly.io (In Progress)

We will deploy our website to Fly.io using the [Fly CLI](https://fly.io/docs/getting-started/installing-flyctl/).
